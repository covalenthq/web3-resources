        "## What is a Wallet in Web3?\n",
        "Wallets are fundamental in Web3 as they serve as a digital identity to access applications. Just like a web browser is the *client* used to access a webpage, wallets are *clients* which enable you to access blockchain-powered applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Web 2 vs Web3 clients](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*qtAW0sX8jwsj7sOY)\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, wallets provide *access* to digital assets such as fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) by allowing the wallet owner to sign transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Wallet keys](https://images.ctfassets.net/0idwgenf7ije/6nHv8TLpKDInxwu4z9Zmsb/6db5b1cf5eac1c7db05e843c95f217fe/Gemini-Security_Public_and_Private_keys_What_are_Public_and_Private_keys.png?fm=webp)\n",
        "\n",
        "A key point to remember is that a wallet does not actually contain any crypto or tokens. \n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, a wallet consists of three components:\n",
        "1. **A private key** (which you should always keep private) which in web3 is commonly a 256 character binary number (~`10^77`). The private key is an *astronomically* large number for good reason and while the public key is derived from it, the reverse is practically impossible due to one-way cryptography (https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/public-private-keys-cryptography)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **A public key** which serves as a address to send and receive transactions. Think of a public key as a publicly available bank account that someone can send funds to. The public key is derived from a private key.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **A mnenomic (seed phrase)** of usually 12 or 24 words  that can uniquey recreate the private key. The mnemonic serves as a back up to recover your wallet. **It should also always be kept private**. \n",
        "\n",
        "> Deeper dive: See the standard used for generating these mnenomics called the [BIP-39](https://www.blockplate.com/blogs/blockplate/list-of-bip39-wallets-mnemonic-seed) standard. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE: EVERYTHING WE DO HERE IS FOR DEMO PURPOSES SO PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY WALLETS CREATED HERE AS YOUR PRODUCTION WALLET!**\n",
        "\n",
        "&nbsp;\n",
        "## Create a Wallet from First Principles\n",
        "Since the public key and mnenomic are derived from the private key, and a private key is just a random 256 bit number, we can just create a private key from scratch using a Python module like [`secrets`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) which generates secure random numbers for managing secrets. \n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, we are going to use the [`eth_account`](https://eth-account.readthedocs.io/en/stable/eth_account.html#module-eth_account.account) Python library (which was automatically installed with `Web3.py`) to help us derive the public key and mnemonic from the private key. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our process looks something like the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Use the `secrets` module and specifically the [`token_hex()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html#secrets.token_hex) method to generate our private key. This method \"returns a random text string, in hexadecimal. The string has nbytes random bytes, each byte converted to two hex digits.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "> Q) 256 bits is how many bytes?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Prefix a `0x` string in front of our random number to indicate it is a hexadecimal. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. Use the [`Account.from_key()`](https://eth-account.readthedocs.io/en/stable/eth_account.html#eth_account.account.Account.from_key) method to generate a convenient account object. \n",
        "\n",
