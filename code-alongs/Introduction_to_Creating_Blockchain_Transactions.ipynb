        "> Deeper dive: Learn all the nuances of [gas fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/)\n",
        "\n",
        "After the implementation of [EIP-1559](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/#eip-1559), the gas fee structure is more complex but essentially boils down to the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "- To transfer ETH between accounts, the transaction requires a fixed amount of 21,000 gas units. \n",
        "\n",
        "- The fee per gas unit is made up of two components:\n",
        "  1. A `base fee` which is set by the network and burned\n",
        "  2. A `priority fee` or tip given to the validator\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's say Jordan has to pay Taylor 1 ETH. In the transaction, the gas limit is 21,000 units and the base fee is 10 gwei (10^9 wei). Jordan includes a tip of 2 gwei.\n",
        "\n",
        "  `21,000 * (10 + 2) = 252,000 gwei or 0.000252 ETH.`\n",
        "\n",
        "When Jordan sends the money, 1.000252 ETH will be deducted from Jordan's account. Taylor will be credited 1.0000 ETH. Validator receives the tip of 0.000042 ETH. Base fee of 0.00021 ETH is burned.\n",
        "\n",
        "The nice thing is that there are methods to determine the gas values for you so that you **do not need to manually calculate them.**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Update the Transaction Object\n",
        "\n",
        "The additional keys we need to add to our `txn_obj` are:\n",
        "1. `gas` - in this simple ETH transfer case, that is 21,000 units but we can use the [`eth_estimateGas`](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.eth.html#web3.eth.Eth.estimate_gas) RPC method to estimate this for a given transaction object. \n",
        "\n",
        "The next two offer some 'finer tuning' based on 1) how quickly and 2) how costly we want our transaction to be processed. We can provide **either one of these or both** for full control:\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `maxPriorityFeePerGas` - this is the maximum 'tip' offered to the validator to process your transaction. We can use the [`eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas`](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.eth.html#web3.eth.Eth.max_priority_fee) RPC method to return a suggested for a max priority fee. \n",
        "\n",
        "3. `maxFeePerGas` - This is the overall maximum fee paid per gas unit and includes the tip but no guarantee on *when* your transaction will be processed. Essentially:\n",
        "\n",
        "  `maxFeePerGas = baseFeePerGas + maxPriorityFeePerGas`. \n",
        "\n",
        "Since we do not have an explicit method for the `maxFeePerGas`, we can manually determine this using the [`eth_getBlockByNumber`](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.eth.html#web3.eth.Eth.get_block) RPC method for the `'pending'` block and extract the `baseFeePerGas` value. "
